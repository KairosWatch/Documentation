# Kairos - Documentation

This repository is meant to store all datasheets from devices
we use on [KairosWatch](https://github.com/kairos-dev/KairosWatch) and [KairOS](https://github.com/kairos-dev/KairOS), and references from FreeRTOS.

You can find the datasheets from devices on "Devices" folder. Inside this folder we have "Datasheets", used to store datasheets from a specific devices(microcontrollers, sensors, transceivers and so on.).
And "Modules" folder, used to store references from modules we used.
